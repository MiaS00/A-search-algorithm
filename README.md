# A* search algorithm

In computer science, A* (pronounced as "A star") is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. The process of plotting an efficiently directed path between multiple points, called "nodes". It is widely used because of well performance and accuracy. However, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance, although other work has found A* better than other approaches.
